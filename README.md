👋 Hi there!

I am a developer capable of creating Windows applications. 🧑‍💻


Over the course of a year, I participated in the development of a 3D medical imaging software used in dentistry, utilizing C++ MFC and VTK libraries. 🦷

Currently, I am engaged in the development of medical PACS software using C# WPF.🏥


And I find game development very exciting, so after my work hours, I return home to pursue it as a hobby.🎮
